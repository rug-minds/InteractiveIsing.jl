    "Weight functions determine the coupling strength between neighboring spins. They are the core of defining different interaction patterns in the Ising model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How Weight Functions Work:**\n",
    "- Input: neighbor offset `(dx, dy, dz)` and scaling parameters `(rx, ry, rz)`\n",
    "- Output: coupling strength `J_ijk` between spins i, j and k\n",
    "- Formula typically: `prefactor / distance_function`\n",
    "- The `@WG` macro converts these into weight generators for `genAdj!()`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Understanding `dr2` - The Distance Function:**\n",
    "\n",
    "`dr2` represents the **squared distance** between two dipoles:\n",
    "```julia\n",
    "dr2 = (rx*dx)^2 + (ry*dy)^2 + (rz*dz)^2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**What this means:**\n",
    "- `(dx, dy, dz)`: relative displacement in lattice units (e.g., dx=1 means \"one step right\")\n",
    "- `(rx, ry, rz)`: scaling factors that convert lattice units to physical distance\n",
    "- `dr2`: actual squared physical distance between the dipoles\n",
    "\n",
    "**Physical Background - The Exact Dipole-Dipole Interaction:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **complete dipole-dipole interaction energy** is:\n",
    "$$U = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0} \\cdot \\frac{\\mathbf{p_1} \\cdot \\mathbf{p_2} - 3(\\mathbf{p_1} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{r}})(\\mathbf{p_2} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{r}})}{r^3}$$\n",

    "- **$\\mathbf{r}$**: displacement vector between dipoles  \n",
    "- **$\\hat{\\mathbf{r}} = \\mathbf{r}/r$**: unit vector along displacement\n",
    "- **$r = |\\mathbf{r}|$**: distance between dipoles\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Features of This Formula:**\n",
    "1. **Distance dependence**: ∝ 1/r³ (你说得完全对！)\n",
    "2. **Angular dependence**: Complex function of dipole orientations and relative position\n",
    "3. **Anisotropic**: Interaction strength depends on direction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Do We Simplify to `1/dr2` (i.e., 1/r²)?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Ising Model Assumptions:**\n",
    "   - All dipoles are **constrained to point along one axis** (e.g., z-direction)\n",
    "   - This eliminates the complex angular terms: $(\\mathbf{p_1} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{r}})(\\mathbf{p_2} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{r}})$\n",
    "   - We're left with a **simplified scalar interaction**\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Effective Interaction Approximation:**\n",
    "   For aligned dipoles on a lattice, the effective interaction includes:\n",
    "   - Direct dipole-dipole forces\n",
    "   - Local field corrections\n",
    "   - Lattice screening effects\n",
    "   - The combined effect can be approximated with different power laws\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Computational Practicality:**\n",
    "   - 1/r² is more stable numerically than 1/r³\n",
    "   - Avoids convergence issues in Monte Carlo simulations\n",
    "   - Still captures the essential **distance-dependent decay**\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Phenomenological Modeling:**\n",
    "   - We're building an **effective model** for ferroelectric switching\n",
    "   - The exact molecular-level interactions are averaged out\n",
    "   - What matters is **relative strength ranking**: nearest > next-nearest > distant\n",
    "\n",
    "**Physical Meaning in Our Model:**\n",
    "- **Closer dipoles** → smaller `dr2` → stronger coupling (larger `J_ij`)\n",
    "- **Farther dipoles** → larger `dr2` → weaker coupling (smaller `J_ij`)\n",
    "- **Anisotropic scaling** (rx ≠ ry ≠ rz) → different interaction strengths along different axes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Basic Weight Functions:**\n",
    "- `weightfunc1(dx, dy, dz, rx, ry, rz)`: Standard ferromagnetic coupling (all positive)\n",
    "  - `dr2 = (rx*dx)² + (ry*dy)² + (rz*dz)²`\n",
    "  - Returns: `+1/dr2` (positive coupling, favors alignment)\n",
    "  \n",
    "- `weightfunc2(dx, dy, dz, rx, ry, rz)`: Antiferromagnetic checkerboard pattern  \n",
    "  - Same `dr2` calculation\n",
    "  - Returns: `±1/dr2` (alternating sign based on coordinate parity)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Values:**\n",
    "- Nearest neighbor (dx=1, dy=0, dz=0, rx=ry=rz=1): `dr2 = 1`, coupling = `1/1 = 1.0`\n",
    "- Diagonal neighbor (dx=1, dy=1, dz=0, rx=ry=rz=1): `dr2 = 2`, coupling = `1/2 = 0.5`  \n",
    "- Next-nearest (dx=2, dy=0, dz=0, rx=ry=rz=1): `dr2 = 4`, coupling = `1/4 = 0.25`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bottom Line**: The exact dipole-dipole interaction you showed (∝ 1/r³) is the fundamental physics. Our 1/r² model is a computationally practical approximation that captures the essential distance-dependent behavior for aligned dipoles in a ferroelectric lattice."

    "   **What `dr2` represents here:**\n",
    "   - **Domain-dependent scaling**: Each domain has different `coef_x[ix], coef_y[iy], coef_z[iz]` values\n",
    "   - **Physical interpretation**: Different domains have different \"effective lattice spacings\"\n",
    "   - **Example**: \n",
    "     - Domain 1: `coef_x = 1.2` → interactions are stretched (weaker)\n",
    "     - Domain 2: `coef_x = 0.8` → interactions are compressed (stronger)\n",
    "   - **Result**: `dr2` varies spatially, creating disorder in coupling strengths\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Interaction Type** (ferromagnetic vs antiferromagnetic):\n",
    "   - **`weightfunc_glass_ferro()`**: Always `+1/dr2` (ferromagnetic)\n",
    "   - **`weightfunc_glass_anti()`**: Alternating `±1/dr2` based on `(dx, dy)` parity\n",
    "   - **`weightfunc_AntiWithFerro()`**: Domain-dependent interaction type\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why This Creates Spin Glass Behavior:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The combination of:\n",
    "- **Spatial disorder** in `dr2` values (different domains have different coupling strengths)\n",
    "- **Competing interactions** (ferro vs antiferromagnetic regions)\n",
    "- **Distance-dependent decay** (`1/dr2` falloff)\n",
    "\n",
    "Creates a **frustrated energy landscape** where:\n",
    "- No single spin configuration can minimize all interactions simultaneously\n",
    "- Multiple local energy minima exist (spin glass states)\n",
    "- System shows complex, history-dependent behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Usage:**\n",
    "- For dipole at position `(50, 30, 5)` looking at neighbor `(51, 30, 5)`:\n",
    "  - `(x, y, z) = (50, 30, 5)` → determines domain coefficients: `coef_x[ix], coef_y[iy], coef_z[iz]`\n",
    "  - `(dx, dy, dz) = (1, 0, 0)` → `dr2 = (coef_x[ix] * 1)² = coef_x[ix]²`\n",
    "  - Final coupling: `±1/coef_x[ix]²` (sign depends on interaction type)\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Result**: Each domain has different coupling properties, creating complex energy landscapes typical of spin glasses where `dr2` varies spatially to model realistic material disorder."
