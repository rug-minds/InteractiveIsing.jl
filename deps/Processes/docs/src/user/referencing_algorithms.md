# [Referencing Algorithms](@id referencing_algorithms_user)

Use this page whenever you need to point to a specific algorithm in:

- `Route(...)`
- `Share(...)`
- `Input(...)`
- `Override(...)`

## One Rule

Reference algorithms the same way you inserted them into the composition.

- Added by type -> reference by that type.
- Added by saved instance variable -> reference by that same variable.
- Added by `Unique(...)` -> reference by that same saved unique variable.

## Pattern 1: Added by Type

```julia
struct Producer <: ProcessAlgorithm end
struct Consumer <: ProcessAlgorithm end

algo = CompositeAlgorithm(
    Producer, Consumer,
    (1, 1),
    Route(Producer => Consumer, :value),
)
```

Use `Producer` and `Consumer` again when targeting these algorithms.

## Pattern 2: Added by Instance

```julia
producer = Producer()
consumer = Consumer()

algo = CompositeAlgorithm(
    producer, consumer,
    (1, 1),
    Route(producer => consumer, :value),
)
```

Use `producer` and `consumer` again, not fresh `Producer()` calls.

## Pattern 3: Added with `Unique`

```julia
producer_a = Producer()
producer_b = Unique(Producer())
consumer = Consumer()

algo = CompositeAlgorithm(
    producer_a, producer_b, consumer,
    (1, 1, 1),
    Route(producer_b => consumer, :value),
)
```

`producer_b` is a distinct identity. Keep that variable and reuse it anywhere you need to target that exact algorithm.

## Common Mistake

Do not create a new object in `Route`/`Share`/`Input`/`Override` unless that exact object was inserted in the composition.
