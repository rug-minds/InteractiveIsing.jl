Flexible worker orchestrator.

Recipes may be named tuples containing callbacks, or concrete objects that
overload the callback functions below. The default worker protocol supports
`Process` workers.

For each job, the manager moves through fixed lifecycle steps: assign a free
slot, call `prepare!`, call `runarguments`, implicitly run the worker, poll for
completion, finalize, consume, release, and eventually flush. Attach behavior to
these steps with recipe callbacks. For example, `prepare!` may mutate or
reinitialize a worker context, and `runarguments` may return keyword arguments
for `run(slot.worker; kwargs...)`.

When `workers` is omitted, the recipe must define `makeworker`. The manager calls
`makeworker` once to create a template worker, then copies that template for the
remaining slots. The default `Process` copy reuses the template task description
and deep-copies the runtime context. Recipes can define
`makecontext(idx, manager, template)` to build a separate `Process` context for
each slot while keeping the template task description, or
`copyworker(template, idx, manager)` when the whole worker copy must be custom. When
`workers` is passed, the manager wraps those existing workers in slots and does
not create new worker contexts.

Set `worker_init = MakeEachWorker()` to call `makeworker(idx, manager)` for every
owned slot instead of copying slot 1. This avoids the manager's deepcopy-based
default `Process` copy path entirely. Pass `worker_init_data = data` to provide
one value per worker; callbacks may accept it as `makeworker(idx, manager, data)`.

Use `worker_lifecycle = OnDemandWorkers()` when workers should be constructed
from job data instead of upfront. That mode lives in `OnDemandWorkers.jl` and
uses `makeworker(idx, manager, job)` for each dispatched job. Pass
`worker_type` when the job may choose among different concrete worker types.

Slots have a public `name` field for logs and result lookup. Missing
`workername` callbacks use names such as `:worker_1`. Pass `name_type` if names
should use a type other than `Symbol`.

The `job_type`, `scratch_type`, `result_type`, and `error_type` keywords let
latency-sensitive code make worker slot fields concrete. Leaving them as `Any`
keeps the manager fully flexible.
